# Transformer Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model in PyTorch. The repository is organized into modular files for better readability and maintainability, making it suitable for learning and experimenting with Transformers.

## Features

- Modular implementation of the Transformer model.
- Easy-to-configure hyperparameters via `config.py`.
- Dataset handling and preprocessing using `dataset.py`.
- Training pipeline provided in `train.py`.
- Implements attention mechanisms and feedforward networks as described in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper.

## Repository Structure

```
transformer-implementation/
├── config.py        # Configuration file for model and training settings
├── dataset.py       # Dataset preparation and preprocessing
├── model.py         # Transformer model implementation
├── train.py         # Training script
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- NumPy
- TorchVision

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Ensure your system has a compatible GPU for faster training.

## Usage

### 1. Configure Settings

Modify the `config.py` file to set hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, model dimensions, etc.

### 2. Prepare Dataset

Ensure your dataset is ready for preprocessing. The dataset-related logic can be modified in `dataset.py`.

### 3. Train the Model

Run the `train.py` script to start training:

```bash
python train.py
```

### 4. Model Architecture

The Transformer architecture, including multi-head attention and positional encodings, is implemented in `model.py`.

## Customization

- To modify the dataset or preprocessing logic, edit `dataset.py`.
- To add custom layers or tweak the model, modify `model.py`.
- Adjust training hyperparameters like epochs and learning rate in `config.py`.
